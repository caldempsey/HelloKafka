Executing Kafka
===

In an unmodified setup, since the binaries to execute Kafka are added to PATH, consider both `kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties` and `zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties`. Consult the Cheatsheet at source for more help. The script `runserver.sh` will execute both of these for you.
